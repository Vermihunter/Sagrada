## **Playing the game**

### **Getting to know my board**
When the game starts, all the boards (including yours and all your opponents') are displayed on the screen. The name on the top of the card tells who is the owner of the board. In the bottom right corner are displayed my favor tokens. Each circle means one favor token.

### **What are these icons?**

If you see 3 rectangular icons (a blue die, a grey die and a Sagrada building), don't worry, they supposed to be there. They are icons for the three types of cards: Public objective cards, Your private objective card and the tool cards. By moving your mouse over the icons, you will see a tooltip indicating which kind of cards' icons they are. By clicking on them, you can display the given cards. Click again on the same to hide the cards!


### **When can I move?**

The order in which the players will make their moves are displayed in the middle - right part of the screen in a box with text `Current round state`. The numbers correspond to the numbers next to the name of the player on the top of the board.

### **What moves can I make?**

In each of your turn you can choose from the following moves:
- Pass - don't make any move - could be accomplished by clicking the button with the `Pass` label
- Place a die on the board - first you have to select a die by clicking it. The currently selected die has a black outline. You can change your choice and choose another die. After this, you have to click to the field on your board where you would like to place your die. Be careful! If your move is correct, you will not have a chance to change your move at this point!

- Use a tool card - each tool card has a different handling process. You can select a tool card by clicking on it. The selected tool card will be outlined with red. Be careful! Some tool cards activate by clicking them and you cannot reverse the move! Each tool card has a point when you have to commit using them and cannot choose to make another move. There are tool cards which use the round track e.g. for replacing a die from the supply to one from the round track. You can simply select the die to change and click to the die from the round track that you want to swap with. 

### **What happens if I make a mistake?**

Relax, everything is alright. A response message will be displayed and you can try again making a correct move!

## **How can I end this?**

If you feel like your opponents are taking over, you can click the `Quit` button in the bottom right corner and start a new game!
